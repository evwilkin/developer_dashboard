# Developer Dashboard

### A project dashboard created by a developer for developers.

## Technologies

This is a full MEAN-stack app built on Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node.  I intended for this to be a challenge to myself to implement the technologies we learned towards the end of the course to have a true MEAN app.

## Approach

I threw around many ideas at the start of this project, including a winery-listing app and an app to organize group events both beforehand out during the event.  Ultimately I wanted to create an app that I would use regularly and came up with the idea of a dashboard for tracking projects, todos and miscellaneous notes.

I focused on getting the backend set up first, which proved a little tricky as this was my first hands-on experience with Mongo.  I learned to appreciate how flexible the database structure is, and some of the built-in functions that it provides for you.

## User Stories

I came into this with the viewpoint of my personal experience with projects at General Assembly, which had a specific list of requirements, deliverables, and additional details needed.  As a user, I want to be able to access a list of all my current and past projects, track the requirements and deliverables for each as well as have a sandbox area for todo lists and personal notes.

## Unsolved Mysteries

Moving forward, I plan to implement dynamic arrays for some of the Project fields, touch up the styling to give a more material design flat feel, and improve edit and delete option.  I'd also like to implement different color schemes that the user can choose from.
